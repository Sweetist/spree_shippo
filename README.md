Shippo Spree Extension
=================

The Shippo Spree extensions connects a Spree store with Shippo. Shippo will import all orders via the Spree API, allowing you to obtain shipping labels for your shipping carriers on goshippo.com. Supported carriers include USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL Express, Canada Post and many others. 

The extension will autoamtically create a new Spree user that you need to enter for your Shippo account. The setup is easy:

1. Create a free Shippo account at https://goshippo.com.
2. Enter your Spree's Shippo user API token int he Shippo Spree settings.

Your orders will then be imported automatically. Every shipping label you purchase on Shippo will set the Spree order automatically to "Shipped" and add the tracking number.

Installation
------------

Add spree_shippo_labels to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_shippo_labels'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_shippo_labels:install
```

Configuration
------------

The Shippo extension allows you to automatically register a new Shippo user, if the email address has not been registered on Shippo yet. To opt into auto-registration, set the "shippo_register_automatically" configuration variable in config/initializers/spree_shippo_labels.rb to true:

```ruby
Rails.configuration.shippo_register_automatically = :true
```

After connecting with Shippo for the first time, Shippo will automatically create a Shippo account and send an email to the email address set in Spree.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_shippo_labels/factories'
```
